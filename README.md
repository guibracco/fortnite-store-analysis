Fortnite Battle Royale by Epic Games is one of the most sucessful games in the battle royale genre. Released in 2017, it has been a huge success, with over 350 million players worldwide. The game is free to play, but it has a monetization system based on the sale of cosmetic items, such as skins, emotes, pickaxes, gliders, etc. These items are sold in the Item Shop, which is updated daily with new items. The items are sold for V-Bucks, the in-game currency, which can be bought with real money.

This study intends to cover the availability and monetization of the items daily on sale for Fortnite Battle Royale.

### How

By scraping, cleaning and organising the data available on a fandom website (https://fnbr.co/shop) and exploring availability, seasonality, price range, spending depth, etc. over time to gather insights and answer questions from the game development perspective.

### Why

One of the common practices when designing and developing new games in a determined genre is to study the most successful games in that genre, the so called benchmarks, to get a better understanding of their monetization system and what is needed in the different stages of the game development and adoption.
